  "description": "You're making the new Galvanize website, and need to include a way to accept payment from members. You could code the payment system from scratch, but this is a problem that's been solved many times by many people, so why not reuse their work? Find and use a payment library to accept credit cards on the included site. The site should prompt the user to settle all or some of their $387 outstanding balance. If the payment is successfully processed, the user should see a confirmation message that includes the amount they paid. If the payment is processed unsuccessfully, they should see an error message indicating why.",
